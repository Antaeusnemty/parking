# [Gator Parking]

## Getting Started
This app was created with the intention of helping out people looking for parking in downtown and other high traffic areas of Gainesville, Florida. As well as providing information related to parking like hours when you don't have to pay and information on when some spots become available like taxi only parking.

## Bugs and Issues
Currently google maps takes time to find your location and delays my application displaying of your lat&long and it takes a couple clicks of "Report Parking!" to get the marker to drop and display.
